Github named it. Sounds awesome. No meaning whatsoever.

Just a Vagrant playground sorta thing. Things I want to test:  
- Keep up to speed on Ubuntu  
- Use ansible_local in Vagrant  
- Create some random Ansible playbooks to configure the VM  
- Create some Ansible playbooks to perform some tasks on AWS   
- Maybe spin up some other nodes for Ansible tests
